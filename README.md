# PongGolf

PongGolf is a work-in-progress golfed 2 player Pong game for DOS in assembly
made from scratch for 
[this PPCG challenge](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/10713).

It uses NASM syntax.

As the name suggests, it is designed to be as small as possible (although
currently, I am just trying to get it working ^.^
